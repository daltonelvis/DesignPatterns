Adaptor Design Pattern is used when we want a legacy or existing code to be compatible with something new without changing the legacy code. Here we do not add any new functionalities but reuse the legacy code and make it compatible 

For Example Intially we ceated an application to get the weather details from Accweather service but later on Accuwhether service went down or started charging and so we found a recplacement service from Yahooweatherservice. Now to easily shift from Accuwhether to yahoo weather we can easily do so by writing a YahooWeatherAdaptor
