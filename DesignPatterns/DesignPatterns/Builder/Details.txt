Builder pattern is creational pattern used when we need to split the object creation, 
In my example we are creating a computer object but all the fields of computer class are
not always applicable for example desktop has keyboard and mouse but laptop does not have since its in built 
similarly laptop can have touch screen but desktop cannot have touchscreen
if we create a computer class in a normal way we will have to provide null values in the constructor for the
fields which are not applicable.


In our case we only set the fields that are always required in constructor and other fields are set via separate methods like AddMouse, AddTouchScreen etc.
